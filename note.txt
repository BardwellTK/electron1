Initially, I am cloning an existing electron repository by just manually rewriting the code to try to gather an understanding of the components of web development. Not that I am illiterate in web development, but, very much a beginner. After, I will continue to tinker with the app and just add things as I go along, to try and broaden my knowledge in the field.

Operational, will work on more tomorrow.
This should commit via shh?
Okay, need to set up an ssh key, will do tomorrow
ssh should now be setup.


added some new elements to the page.
play with css / js on them next

plan is to remake first year project in here.
So, a petrol station with random cars being generated and docking in the petrol station, having random vehicle types, fuel requirements, and tank percentages. They take a corresponding amount of time to fill up their tanks. They are charged for their fuel, based on type and quantity. A receipt of their purchase is then added to an exportable database.

Also a login, because having the ability to set up a decent login page will prove useful to myself.
